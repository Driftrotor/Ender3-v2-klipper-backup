###########################
------PID CALIBRATION------
###########################

it is a good idea to first run a PID calibration test first.

PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=extruder TARGET=215
PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=60

the extruder is a mid point calibration as i find it works for most filament without having to re-calibrate fir different materials.
the heater build plate is set for 60 at this is my PLA setting (majority of what i print) but will need to be re-calibrated for higher temps.


##########################
------END STOP PHASE------
##########################

This is used to get endstops nice and consistant. the config will save the motor step (full step) on triggering the end stop and stop the motor at the same step every time after saving.

ENDSTOP_PHASE_CALIBRATE STEPPER=stepper_x
ENDSTOP_PHASE_CALIBRATE STEPPER=stepper_y
ENDSTOP_PHASE_CALIBRATE STEPPER=stepper_z

run these comands after homing the printer then save config.

------E steps calculation / Rotational distacnce for extruded material------
############################################################################

Different materials have different flow rates.
calibration of eacg type of filament may be nessesary, even different colours of the same type of material.

have nozzel at extrusion temp for calibration (STABLE)
PLA (200ISH)
ABS (240ISH)

measure 120mm from top of extruder and mark with marker
Use command  -----G1 E100 F50----- in comand line 
measure from top of extruder to mark (should be 20mm)
run calc to determin if new rotational distance is required.

-----rotation_distance = <full_steps_per_rotation> * <microsteps> / <steps_per_mm>
-----Use the digital calipers to measure the new distance between the extruder body and the mark on the filament. 
-----Note this as <subsequent_mark_distance>. Then calculate: actual_extrude_distance = <initial_mark_distance> - <subsequent_mark_distance>
-----Calculate rotation_distance as: rotation_distance = <previous_rotation_distance> * <actual_extrude_distance> / <requested_extrude_distance>
-----Round the new rotation_distance to three decimal places.

My rotational distance = 22.934


#############################
------PREASSURE ADVANCE------
#############################

Use a slicer to generate g-code for the large hollow square found in docs/prints/square_tower.stl. Use a high speed (eg, 100mm/s), zero infill, and a coarse layer height 
(the layer height should be around 75% of the nozzle diameter). Make sure any "dynamic acceleration control" is disabled in the slicer.

---Prepare for the test by issuing the following G-Code command:---

SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT SQUARE_CORNER_VELOCITY=1 ACCEL=500

---This command makes the nozzle travel slower through corners to emphasize the effects of extruder pressure. Then for printers with a direct drive extruder run the command:---

TUNING_TOWER COMMAND=SET_PRESSURE_ADVANCE PARAMETER=ADVANCE START=0 FACTOR=.005

---For long bowden extruders use:---

TUNING_TOWER COMMAND=SET_PRESSURE_ADVANCE PARAMETER=ADVANCE START=0 FACTOR=.020

---Then print the object.---

The pressure_advance value can then be calculated as pressure_advance = <start> + <measured_height> * <factor>.     (For example, 0 + 12.90 * .005 would be 0.0645.)

It is possible to choose custom settings for START and FACTOR if that helps identify the best pressure advance setting. When doing this, be sure to issue the TUNING_TOWER command at the start of each test print.
Typical pressure advance values are between 0.050 and 1.000 (the high end usually only with bowden extruders). If there is no significant improvement with a pressure advance up to 1.000, then pressure advance is unlikely to improve the quality of prints. Return to a default configuration with pressure advance disabled.

PLA = 0.082
ABS = 0.091

####################################################
------FLOW RATE COMPENSATION / extrsion factor------
####################################################

This is a fine tuning of material flow after rotational distance is calibrated for the mechanical side.
Each material will have a different flow rate and thus we can adjust for this.
PLA is typically 100% flow rate as this is normally the material choice for rotational distance calibration.
The main calibration test for this is to print the 40x40x40 cube in vase mode and 2 base layers [for adhetion] and print at a nice slow speed [25mm/s2] is a good speed. we want to check we are getting a nice even extrusion of filament.
After the print is finished, measure each side about the middle in 3 places taking the measurements down. [0.45mm for a 0.4mm nozzle is perfect] once that is done devide by 12. this will give you the new mean extrstion width.
the calculation for flow / Extrusion factor;

Extrusion multiplier = (Extrusion width (0.45) / Average measured wall thickness) x 100


###################
------BED MESH-----
###################

BED_MESH_CALIBRATE

this will initiate the bed mesh calibration and save the results to the default profile unless a profile is specified.


############################
------PREASURE ADVANCE------
############################

Use a slicer to generate g-code for the large hollow square found in [docs/prints/square_tower.stl]
Use a high speed (eg, 100mm/s), zero infill, and a coarse layer height (the layer height should be around 75% of the nozzle diameter). Make sure any "dynamic acceleration control" is disabled in the slicer.
Enter the following into the command line before starting the print.

SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT SQUARE_CORNER_VELOCITY=1 ACCEL=500

TUNING_TOWER COMMAND=SET_PRESSURE_ADVANCE PARAMETER=ADVANCE START=0 FACTOR=.005

For long bowden extruders use:

TUNING_TOWER COMMAND=SET_PRESSURE_ADVANCE PARAMETER=ADVANCE START=0 FACTOR=.020

The above TUNING_TOWER command instructs Klipper to alter the pressure_advance setting on each layer of the print. Higher layers in the print will have a larger pressure advance value set.
Layers below the ideal pressure_advance setting will have blobbing at the corners, and layers above the ideal setting can lead to rounded corners and poor extrusion leading up to the corner.

Inspect the print and then use a digital calipers to find the height that has the best quality corners. When in doubt, prefer a lower height.

The pressure_advance value can then be calculated as 
pressure_advance = <start> + <measured_height> * <factor>

The pressure advance value is dependent on the extruder, the nozzle, and the filament. It is common for filament from different manufactures or with different pigments to require significantly different pressure advance values. 
Therefore, you should calibrate pressure advance on each printer and with each spool of filament.

------WPA_SUPLICANT.CONF------
##############################

To reprograme the WPA web service for another wifi you need to modify the WPA_SUPLICANT.CONF file.
you can do this by plugging in the Rpi to the modem with a Cat5 cable and enter SSH, once logged in enter this code line.

sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

this will take you to the file to edit, enter the new WIFI details and then "Ctrl + O" to save the file, confirm the file name and press ENTER.
now reboot your Rpi after unplugging the Cat5.
this should now show up on the router, note the IP address and your good to go.


OR we can do it from the comand line, enter this line to add the new SSID details.


sudo sh -c "wpa_passphrase 'ssid' 'password' >> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf"


change the 'ssid' and 'password' to your wifi network criteria. ei. your network name and password.
this will enter the new network details to the WPA_SUPLICANT.CONF file.
to take a look at the file enter this comand line.


sudo cat /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf


remove the hashed password part for security.
press "Ctrl + X and Ctrl + Y" to exit and save the file.
now enter this command line to reconfigure the network.


sudo wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconfigure


it should report back "OK".
we are good to go.

################################
----klipper backups-------------
################################

create github repo--- this is the back up place to keep the files eg. ender3-v2-backups

next you need to create a token to be able to push updates to that repo
got to settings...dev...personal access token...fine grained token
from there you can set up the token to link with the repo you just made.
permisions to set are...
read/write access to code & workflows

after that is set up
run these scripts in ssh one by one


cd ~ git clone https://github.com/Staubgeborener/klipper-backup klipper-backup-main
chmod +x ./klipper-backup-main/*.sh && ./klipper-backup-main/install.sh



cd ~/printer_data/config



wget -O /home/pi/printer_data/config/autocommit.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/VoronTools/main/autocommit.sh



nano /home/pi/printer_data/config/autocommit.sh
# this one opens the file to make sure your using the correct web interface... comment / uncomment what you need to #



chmod +x autocommit.sh



git init -b main



###   now we need to generate the git location + the token to push updates to git   ###
###   https://github_pat_<token_number>github.com/ <your git hub> / <repo name> .git   ###
###   it should look like this above   ###
enter this...

git remote add origin <the bit above>



git remote -v

this will test it



 git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
 git config --global user.name "your name"

enter these or the script will error out



cd klipper-backup

ls -a

sudo nano .env

this is the pace to set up what gets backed up (most is already done just remove what you dont want)
you also need to add in the "repo name" & "the token" at the top

ctr + x to save



next check the .gitignore is set up to not expose your settings (IMPORTANT)

sudo nano .gitignore

it should contain the .env file name



now we got to kiauh...

cd

kiauh/kiauh.sh

select 4

select 8

run g-code shell script

this allows the script to run


that should be it for the ssh part


now copy this into your MOON RAKER CONF

[update_manager client klipper-backup]
type: git_repo
path: ~/klipper-backup
origin: https://github.com/Staubgeborener/klipper-backup.git
install_script: install.sh
is_system_service: False
primary_branch: main



now copy this into you PRINTER.CFG

[gcode_macro update_git]
gcode:
    RUN_SHELL_COMMAND CMD=update_git_script

[gcode_shell_command update_git_script]
command: bash /home/pi/klipper-backup/script.sh
timeout: 90.0
verbose: True


now restart your printer

a button should be added to your macros
this is a simple button to push an update to github

your all set!
